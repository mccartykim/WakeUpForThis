# Stupid Phone Tricks

I have stuff to do at my stint at the RC, but I also like my bed.  My brain seems to think sleep is good, and programming is bad, but it turns out society, employers, and my sense of self-esteem do not agree.

Usually, society uses the stick rather than the carrot to get you in the door.  But it turns out they probably won't expel me from the RC for sleeping in and being unreliable.  So the ball is in my court, and punishing myself feels weird.  So, the best strategy is to take something good I don't usually give myself, and give myself that goodness in the right situation.

So, I figured, let's get my lizard and mamalian brains something to respond to while the rest of my faculties are still warming up.

My basic plan is: Prove I'm in the right place at the right time.  Use that to trigger something good.  Reward brain.

For being in the right place at the right time, my mind turns to the sensors/networking in my laptop/phone.  I really like the idea of a silly app that gets all huffy if you load it in the wrong place on my phone.

For the reward, I'm thinking some kind of David Letterman clip.  They're on youtube and the content owners haven't seen fit to take them down, and they're delightful.  I figure even if I'm sleepy and disheveled, a stupid pet trick is still fun.  Chris Elliot impressions might be a bit advanced for Sleepy Kim.

So for this silly warmup, I'm thinking I'll use Android Studio to make a very specific, very silly app.  It'll check the time and place, and either show me a random Letterman video, or tell me I need to be at the recurse center at my start time.
